	 * An array can hold the value of the same data type. It never allows holding
	 * values of a different datatype. If you are declaring an array of int type it
	 * means it can hold only its values. It can’t take a value of String type etc.
	 * An array is stored in contiguous memory allocation. All the values are stored
	 * in order and each value placed on an index which starts from 0. You can
	 * declare an Array as local if you are declaring it in the method. The size of
	 * the array is specified only by int value. You can’t use any other data type
	 * to specify the size of the array. Like other classes, Array also extends its
	 * superclass Object. Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and
	 * java.io.Serializable. An array can store primitive data types and
	 * Non-primitive data types.
