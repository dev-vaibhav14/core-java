	 * 1. Like an ArrayList, A LinkedList can contain duplicate elements. Because
	 * each element stored as a separate node and there can be multiple nodes with
	 * the same data. 2. The LinkedList maintains the order of insertion. Each and
	 * every element stores the address of the next element. 3. The Head is the
	 * first element of the LinkedList and the last element is known as Tail. The
	 * Head object doesn’t have a previous address and Tail object doesn’t have next
	 * 3. A LinkedList can contain any number of null values. 4. LinkedList class is
	 * non synchronized. 5. LinkedList only constructs the empty list without any
	 * initial capacity. It means it doesn’t provide the default capacity. 6.
	 * LinkedList can’t be used for primitive types (like int, char, etc). 7.
	 * LinkedList doesn’t allows us to randomly access the list. Because it doesn’t
	 * implement the RandomAccess interface. 8. LinkedList is fast in manipulation
	 * because no shifting needs to occur.
